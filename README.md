# ðŸ’± StableX - FX Stablecoin Vault DEX

StableX is a decentralized foreign exchange platform for stablecoins built on Solana. It uses a vault-based architecture for efficient oracle-driven FX swaps and single-sided liquidity provision.

## Features

- **Single-sided LP positions**: Provide liquidity to a single stablecoin vault
- **Oracle-based pricing**: Real-time FX rates from Pyth oracles
- **Dynamic spreads**: Fees adjust based on vault imbalance
- **Capital efficiency**: No impermanent loss for LPs
- **Proportional rewards**: Earn fees based on your share of the vault

## Architecture

Unlike traditional AMMs that use token pairs in a single pool, StableX uses separate vaults for each stablecoin:

- One vault = one token
- Oracle provides the exchange rate
- LPs earn rewards from their specific vault
- Dynamic spreads balance supply and demand

## Quick Start
